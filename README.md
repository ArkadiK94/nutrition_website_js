# nutrition_website_js
Project that I did due to a Udemy Course that I took.
The name of the course "Полный курс по JavaScript + React - с нуля до результата"

Technologies that we used:
1. webpack - to make the project in modular structure
2. json - for saving posted data from user and getting data from the server 
3. programing language : VanillaJS 

In this project we did the following functionalities:
1. tabs
2. timer
3. modal windows and post the data that the user fill in the form to the server
4. menu tabs that come from server
5. show the response from the server to the user: succeed, loading, failed
6. using two diffrent web APIs that interact with servers: XMLHttpRequset and fetch
7. making slider in 2 ways (both without libraries)
8. making a calculator
